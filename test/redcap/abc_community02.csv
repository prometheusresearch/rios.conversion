inter_instructions,"The ABC-Community rating scale is designed to be used with clients living in the community. Please note that the term client is used throughout to refer to the person being rated. This may be a child of school age, an adolescent, or an adult.

Please rate this client's behavior for the last four weeks. For each item, decide whether the behavior is a problem and circle the appropriate number:

0 = not at all a problem
1 = the behavior is a problem but slight in degree
2 = the problem is moderately serious
3 = the problem is severe in degree

When judging this client's behavior, please keep the following points in mind:

(a) Take relative frequency into account for each behavior specified. For example if the client averages more temper outburst than most other clients you know or most others in his/her class, it is probably moderately serious (2) or severe (3) even if these occur only once or twice a week. Other behaviors, such as noncompliance, would probably have to occur more frequently to merit an extreme rating.

(b) If you have access to this information, consider the experience of other care providers with this client. If the client has problems with others but not with you, try to take the whole picture into account. 

(c) Try to consider whether a given behavior interferes with his/her development, functioning, or relationships. For example, body rocking or social withdrawal may not disrupt other children or adults, but it almost certainly hinders individual development or functioning.

Do not spend too much time on each item -- your first reaction is usually the right one.",,,,instruction,,page_2
